## Day 2: Introduction to Arrays and Basic Array Manipulation Algorithms
Arrays in JavaScript
An array is a data structure that holds a collection of elements, which can be of the same or different data types. Each element in an array has an index, starting from 0 for the first element.

### Basic Array Manipulation Algorithms
Let's explore some basic array manipulation algorithms:

1. Accessing Elements: Use square brackets ([]) to access elements by their index.

2. Inserting Elements: Use the push() method to add elements to the end of an array.

3. Removing Elements: Use methods like pop() to remove the last element and splice() to remove elements at specific indexes.

4. Finding Elements: Use the indexOf() method to find the index of a specific element.

5. Updating Elements: Assign new values to elements by their index.
